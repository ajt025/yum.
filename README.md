# yum.
Introduction:
Yum is an android application determined on shifting the focus away from reviewing restaurants, to reviewing foods. We developed this app mainly because we ourselves wanted an app dedicated to reviewing only food items. Many of us do not care too much about the quality of the restaurant, but rather the quality for the food. Thus, the Yum application is born. Currently, our app allows users to create an account, login, and write reviews for specific food items. Users can also search for food items, read and upvote/downvote other people's reviews and browse through the recommendation tab to find relevant food items they may like.
